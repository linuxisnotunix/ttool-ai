A ship at sea is subject to strong environmental forces (wind, current, swell, etc.). In order to allow them to maintain a predefined position and course, some vessels are equipped with dynamic positioning systems (DPS). The system to design is a DPS consisting of two subsystems:
1. A control console, allowing the user to define the position and course to maintain
2. A controller, responsible for maintaining the ship's position and course:
- based on the setpoint defined by the user and information provided by relevant sensors (force and direction of the wind, drift, angular accelerations)
- by acting on the ship's propulsion and steering system actuators.
This DPS will be installed on a ship equipped with the following sensors: a propeller anemometer (providing the force and direction of the wind), an inertial measurement unit, and a GNSS sensor. The ship's propulsion system also has the following actuators: two azimuth thrusters (thrusters that can rotate 360 degrees) and two bow thrusters (propellers located at the front of the ship, on either side of the hull). Given that the vessel is equipped with azimuth thrusters allowing control of its orientation in addition to its speed, it does not have a separate steering system.
